          <p>
            I love creating new visuals that sparked my interest in web
            development. To improve my knowledge on HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, I
            attended various courses, Udemy web development bootcamps. Based on
            the knowledge gained so far, working on building blogs/sites for
            learning purpose.

          <h3>Athlete</h3>
          <p>
            Ever since I was a child, I have been interested in sports. When I
            was a student, I participated in various sports such as track and
            field, long jump, and shot put, and won many medals. I love the
            adrenaline rush when I'm on the track. I don't attend events, but I
            try to keep that spirit alive through cycling.

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>
            There are some things in life that cannot be expressed in words.
            Photography is like that for me. I am a self-taught photographer and
            I shoot people, animals, mountains, literally anything interesting
            that catches my eye. A picture is worth a thousand words. Instead of
            talking about my work, check out my work on<a

          <h3>Read Stories and Self-help books</h3>
          <p>
            I used to read in my spare time, but now it's my daily routine. I
            love reading books, from fantasy to self-help. It helped keep my
            imagination alive and self-help books helped transform my
            personality and thought process throughout Some of my favourite
            books are Tuesday's with morrie, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Do
            epic shit and so on.

          <h3>Cricket</h3>
          <p>
            Cricket is one of my favorite sports. Most of my school days were
            spent watching and playing with friends and cousins. This was one of
            most important group activities, and I've enjoyed every minute of
            it. I follow cricket updates regularly and watch most of the games.
            I still play when I have the chance.
